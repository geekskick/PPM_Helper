# PPM_Helper
Makes for easy creation of PPM Images. You create the image you want using the `rgb_pixel` class and the `ppm_image`s `<<` operator. 

Access the pixels using the `[]` operator.

Stream out to the destination file using `<<` operator. The example provided is a simple rip off of [SongSim](https://colinmorris.github.io/SongSim/#/abc)
